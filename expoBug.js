While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server failed to start or would crash unexpectedly.  The error messages were inconsistent and didn't point to a clear cause.  I've tried reinstalling Expo CLI, clearing the cache, and restarting my machine, but the problem persists.  The project builds fine on other machines.  The error messages often relate to issues with Metro Bundler and Webpack but are not specific.
