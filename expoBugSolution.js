After extensive debugging, it was discovered that a package in the project's dependencies had conflicting versions or was corrupted. Using `npm dedupe` or `yarn dedupe` to flatten the dependency tree resolved the problem. Additionally, removing and reinstalling the problematic package addressed the incompatibility. Finally, verifying that all packages are compatible with the current Expo version is also key to avoid these issues.
